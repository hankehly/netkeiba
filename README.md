# netkeiba

A python project for scraping and analyzing horse racing data from [netkeiba.com](http://www.netkeiba.com/).

TODO:
- odds frequently change just before race. you need a way to handle that change before making predictions
- time between races is short. you need to be able to scrape and predict faster (single command?)
- consider what type of betting strategy will earn most money
